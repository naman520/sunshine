            Psychological counseling is an important component of pediatric
            occupational therapy, addressing the emotional and behavioral needs
            of children. It helps children develop coping strategies, manage
            anxiety, and improve their emotional regulation, which supports
            their participation in daily activities. By addressing mental health
            alongside physical and cognitive skills, psychological counseling
            ensures a well-rounded approach to a child's development and
            overallÂ well-being.{" "}
